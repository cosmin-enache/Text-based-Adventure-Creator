# Text-based-Adventure-Creator
You start off with an empty board and some cards. You build stories out of those cards.

Here is a deployment of the app so you can try it out: https://dynamic-vacherin-63f013.netlify.app/

## How to use it?

### Modifying a story
You can modify the story that a card represents by typing in text in the card's input as shown below:

### Creating a new choice / story
You can create a new choice for the user by clicking on any card's "+" button. 

A prompt will ask you for the choice you want to include.

A child card will then be created and will be treated as a continuation of the previous card's story, if your user picks the given choice

### Finishing up your story
After you build your branching story, you can click on the 'export story' button at the top-right of your screen.

This will serialize your story into JSON format and paste it into the "Story will be exported here" text area right next to it.

You can then store this JSON data anywhere you want for future use.

### Playing through your story
After you exported your story data, you just need to import (paste it) into the "Paste your story here" text area.

Then, it begins! :)
